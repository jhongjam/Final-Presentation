      <p> The basis of this process was functions. I used functions to create the clouds and bears. The concept of the function was simple. The most difficult part was creating the actual bears.
      This was probably my fastest assignment, as I kept it rather minimal. The spice is in the functions, the base is drawings. I like animals, and I chose to make animals. You may notice
      that the image doesn't really match the name. What kind of farm has bears? I originally planned to make pigs, but I like bears better. They were polar bears at first, but I'm a Grizzly Bear kind of guy.

      <p> This project involved the use of key movements. What was particularly difficult was using the if statements. I actually did it wrong the first time, so the fish moved automatically. 
      With this assignment I developed mastery of the If statements. I wanted this assignment to have an ocean background, and I could have put a variety of other things to fill the background, like boats, but I like animals
        and I was craving fish meat at the time so I put fish in my project. </p>

      <a style= "color: Papayawhip;" href="https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/449313"> Feast your eyes </a> 
      <p>Ahh, the first of many great works. This was the humble beginning. I clearly remember the night I was working on this. I came home from after
      getting cooked at tennis practice. This project was all about the basic drawing commands. As you can tell, I like nature and landscapes, so I based
      this drawing off of my dream environment. The mouse pointer is also quite special; the revered Sharingan. I liked this assignment because it opened my eyes
        to the possibilities and creativity involved with programming. </p>

      <p> I'm very proud of this assignment. The mouse events were not particularly hard, but this project took me the longest out of all the others. 
          As you can see by looking at my code, I had no knowledge of for loops or functions, so it was a rather painstaking process. The details are intricate,
          especially with the car. However, the end result is quite fun to play around with.

      <p> My Magnum Opus. The cream of the crop. The bean on the toast. I consider this assignment as my greatest work of art. Visually, it is the most pleasing.
         The theme follows that of my other drawings, but the inspiration is quite special. Coming directly from Uchiha Itachi, the black crow, it is quite the special drawing.
         I learned about mod operators, which I am quite happy about, because it allows for visually pleasing drawings that can have an infinite number of backdrops. Instead of 1 nature, I can have 3 natures.
